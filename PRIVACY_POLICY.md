## Data Collection

We are committed to protecting your privacy. This application ("CosyVoice_app") is designed to respect your personal data and privacy.

### What Data We Collect

**Minimal Data Collection:**
- **Feedback Emails:** When you choose to send feedback through the application, you voluntarily provide information through your email client. We do not collect or store this information on any servers.
- **Usage Statistics:** The application tracks basic usage statistics locally on your device, including:
  - Number of application launches
  - Number of days used
  - Number of audio files generated
  - Total duration of generated audio
  These statistics are stored locally and are only shared if you choose to include them in feedback emails.

**What We DON'T Collect:**
- No personal identification information (PII) is collected or transmitted
- No audio content is uploaded to any server
- No user behavior tracking or analytics
- No cookies or tracking mechanisms
- No data is shared with third parties

### Local Data Storage

All data generated by this application is stored locally on your device:
- Generated audio files are saved in the `data/generated/` directory

- Temporary files and caches are stored in their respective directories
- Log files are stored in `data/logs/`

You have full control over this data and can delete it at any time through the application's cache management features or by manually deleting the directories.

### Feedback Mechanism
